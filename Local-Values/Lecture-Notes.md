 1. Repeated values across multiple resource blocks increase the code length and make it difficult to manage in larger projects.
 2. One Solution is to Centralize these common values using Variables
 3. "Local Values" are similar to Variables in a sense that it allows to store data centrally that can be referenced in multiple parts of Configuration.

# why to use Local?
1. We can add expressions to locals, which allows to compute values dynamically
